However, after one hit, the cow will be left with 1 health point.\n4. **Final Hit**: The second hit from the stone axe will then kill the cow since it will deal the remaining 9 points of damage.\n\nThus, you need to hit the cow a minimum of **2 times with a stone axe** to kill it."}, "label": ["reason", "math"], "input_tokens": 106, "output_tokens": 227}

Therefore, if a player eats 3 loaves of bread, they would restore a total of 6 hunger points (3 loaves x 2 points each). \n\nSince the player starts with only 3 hunger points left (which translates to 1.5 \"points\"), after consuming 3 loaves, the player would increase their hunger points from 3 to 9 (3 initial + 6 restored).
