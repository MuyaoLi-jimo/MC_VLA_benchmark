To do this, you can hold a lava bucket in your hand and right-click on the water in the structure to place it.\n4. Place a redstone torch on the structure. This will create an infinite water pool that will replenish itself whenever the lava is drained.\n5. Optional: You can add an automatic refiller system to the structure to automatically refill the water whenever it is depleted. To do this, you can place additional water buckets in the structure and use a redstone repeater to trigger the placement of a new bucket every time the old one is drained.\n6. The structure should now function as an infinite water pool with buckets. Use it to fill up buckets and transport water to other locations.\n\nExplanation: The lava and water in the structure will create a block called \"Lava Source Block\" which will replenish itself whenever the lava is drained.
