Crossbow attacks are a type of projectile attack that can be used by players to shoot arrows at enemies or other objects.

It is more commonly used in tools and armor due to its availability and crafting requirements, but it still breaks more easily than other minerals like diamond or gold.\n\nOther minerals, such as gold, diamond, and platinum, have higher hardness and durability, making them better choices for tools and armor that require more endurance."}, "label": ["knowledge", "kill"], "input_tokens": 108, "output_tokens": 254}
