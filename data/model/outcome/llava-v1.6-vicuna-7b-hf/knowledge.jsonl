However, it is a slow and inefficient tool, as diamonds require a lot of time to mine compared to other resources like coal or iron.\n\nExplanation: In Minecraft, different materials have varying durability, which affects the amount of time it takes to mine a resource. Diamonds are one of the hardest materials in the game, and thus require a lot of time and effort to collect. A stone pickaxe has a lower durability compared to other pickaxes made from materials like iron or diamond itself, which makes it even slower and less efficient for mining diamonds.\n\nFor faster and more efficient diamond mining, players typically use pickaxes made from diamond itself or upgraded with enchanted materials like Fortune III. These tools can mine diamonds more quickly and have a lower chance of dropping diamond gems, which can be used to craft other valuable items in the game."}, "label": ["knowledge", "mine"], "input_tokens": 97, "output_tokens": 217}
